=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I applied the spaceship as an abstract 
class and in addition I applied another 
abstract class - a enemy ship that inherits from the spaceship class. 
I chose this design because each spaceship type is an object in itself but they 
are all in "is a" relationship with the spaceship as well as in this relationship with the enemy ship.
Extensibility - New capabilities can be created for each spacecraft, all spacecraft together and all enemy 
spacecraft together thanks to the abstract implement of those classes.
Modularity - There is a platoon for each spacecraft and in addition a platoon that unites all the enemy spacecraft.
drunkard ship behavior - Performs loops within a random radius and shoots at random times.
special ship behavior - crazy spaceship! The spacecraft performs loops and fires in all directions.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
Each spaceship department must implement its unique behavior 
that will be activated in each round by "actionByShipType" method. Therefore this method 
is abstract and each class implement the method. In addition, each type of spaceship 
implement has its own GUI - the human spaceship and the enemy spaceship separately.
